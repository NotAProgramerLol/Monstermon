# This is a Pokemon inspired game named Monstermon

The goal of the game is to battle an opponent that has a few Monsters at his side.

This game is for now pretty boring since i have not implemented a way to choose moves and the monsters are badly balanced.
I also have not implemented things like hit chance, dodging, mana (since i haven't implemented moves yet) and items (for instance a healing potion).
This game is primarily made to show of programming skills (code when writing is still a bit of a mess but thats "fine").

If I find the motivation to keep developing this game then I will probably change most of the code base and use a better tui library. I can probably also use the current one but it will still mean i will need to rewrite my code since i did not separate my back-end and front-end correctly since in some functions i also put the front-end (dialogs) code.
